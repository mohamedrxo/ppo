PPO Gym Trainer
This repository provides a robust implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for training agents in various OpenAI Gym environments. PPO is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm known for its simplicity and effectiveness. The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use framework for experimenting with PPO in different environments.

Features
Customizable PPO Implementation: Includes a modular implementation of the PPO algorithm for flexibility.
Support for Gym Environments: Train agents in any compatible OpenAI Gym environment.
Efficient Training: Utilizes parallelization (if applicable) for faster training.
Performance Tracking: Tracks metrics like rewards and losses using tools like tqdm and TensorBoard.
Save and Load Models: Easily save trained models and load them for evaluation or further training.
Configurable Parameters: Modify hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, discount factor, clip ratio) via configuration files or CLI arguments.
